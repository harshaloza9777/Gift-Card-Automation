          Hi, @{{ issue.user.login }}.

          This is related to code in the Support packages. The support packages contain example code that
          many users find helpful, but they do not necessarily represent the best practices for using Selenium,
          and the Selenium team is not prioritizing work on them right now.
          This doesn't mean that we won't ever work on them, but it is not on our roadmap as we push to release Selenium 5.

          We actively encourage people to create their own wrapper and helper code that makes sense for them.
          If you have any questions, please [contact us](https://www.selenium.dev/support)
      pr:

          Thank you, @{{ pull_request.user.login }} for this code suggestion.

          The support packages contain example code that many users find helpful, but they do not necessarily represent
          the best practices for using Selenium, and the Selenium team is not currently merging changes to them.

          We actively encourage people to add the wrapper and helper code that makes sense for them to their own frameworks.
